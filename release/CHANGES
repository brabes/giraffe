1.0.0-alpha.10 (2020-11-23)

  - Fixed build for GLib >= 2.62.0.
  - Updated configure script to check for MLton include directory under lib64.


1.0.0-alpha.9 (2020-11-15)

  - Updated representation of properties, which changes the way properties
     are accessed as follows:
        `#get <a>Prop`  --->  `Property.get <a>Prop`
        `#set <a>Prop`  --->  `Property.set <a>Prop`
        `#new <a>Prop`  --->  `Property.init <a>Prop`
  - Added bind functions to the module `Property` that provide a type-safe
     interface for binding properties.
  - Added support for accessing fields of a record.
  - Added support for constructing value-like records: for a value-like record
     <R> with no private fields, a function `<R>.new` is generated if no
     function of the same name already exists.
  - SML type for a non-string C array type made abstract as follows:
      - For each C array type, where the SML type of the C element type is
         `<Elem>.t`, the following modules are declared if referenced:
            `structure <Elem>CArray     : C_ARRAY`
            `structure <Elem>CArrayN    : C_ARRAY_N`
            `structure <Elem>CPtrArray  : C_ARRAY`
            `structure <Elem>CPtrArrayN : C_ARRAY_N`
      - The abstract SML type is `<Elem>C[Ptr]Array[N].t` and represents a
         C array as follows:

            C array                                   size
                                      zero terminated      separate parameter

                      packed inline   <Elem>CArray.t       <Elem>CArrayN.t
            elements
                      referenced by   <Elem>CPtrArray.t    <Elem>CPtrArrayN.t
                      a pointer

     (The change in array representation avoids performance issues with large
     arrays by allowing the internal representation to be a C array allocated
     on the C heap that is not necessarily converted to/from an SML value.)
  - SML type for C integer types `gsize` and `gssize` changed from
     `LargeInt.int` to `int`.
  - Added a function that returns the instance type to root classes:
      - `GObject.ObjectClass.instanceType`
      - `GObject.ParamSpecClass.instanceType`
  - Removed bespoke version of `GLib.childWatchSourceNew` that was added
     manually.
  - Fixed introspection metadata for the following functions, which now return
     an optional value:
      - `Gio.InetAddress.newFromString`
      - `Gio.InetSocketAddress.newFromString`
  - Fixed introspection metadata for the following functions, which now return
     a new buffer:
      - `GLib.IOChannel.readChars`
      - `Gio.InputStream.read`
  - Added module Giraffe with functions `exit` and `error`.
  - Updated top-level function `use` to support references to environment
     variables using the notation `$(<var>)` for the value of `<var>`.
  - Updated code generation to use nullable attribute of 'out' and 'inout'
     arguments to determine whether an optional type is used.  With the
     exception of arrays with a size parameter or fixed size zero (which may be
     null when empty), an optional type is used iff nullable is specified.
  - Poly/ML-specific changes:
      - A callback no longer leaks memory.  (A closure, which cannot be freed,
         is now allocated for each callback type only, not for each callback
         instance, following the approach already used for MLton.)
  - Fixed an unlikely but theoretically possible issue where memory for a
     function argument could be freed immediately on returning from the function
     call (because the last use of the memory was for the function argument) but
     some of the memory is referenced in the value passed back from an 'out' or
     'inout' argument and needs to be copied after returning from the call.


1.0.0-alpha.8 (2018-10-17)

  - Removed restriction on Poly/ML 5.7 that required C function argument/return
     values with a C integer type to be in the range of `Int.int` which, in
     practice, required `Int` to be the same as `IntInf`.
  - Generated C wrapper functions for use with MLton so all functions supported.
  - Generated C functions to determine the size of value-like records.
  - Updated library versions:
        GLib 2.0            2.50.3
        GIRepository 2.0    1.50.0
        Atk 1.0             2.22.0
        Pango 1.0           1.40.9
        GdkPixbuf 2.0       2.36.9
        GTK+ 3.0            3.22.17
        GtkSourceView 3.0   3.22.2
        Vte 2.90            0.36.5
        Vte 2.91            0.46.3
  - Included deprecated functions in generated code.
  - GLib namespace is loaded before GObject namespace.
  - Added `GObject.Object.new`.
  - Fixed property operators to respect construct-only mode.
  - Supported case-insensitive file systems.
  - Fixed use of dynamic loader with Poly/ML under Darwin.


1.0.0-alpha.7 (2017-10-18)

  - Poly/ML 5.6 required.
  - Poly/ML 5.7 supported.
  - Poly/ML-specific changes:
      - Introduced finalizers based on weak references.
      - Used the new FFI (provided by the structure Foreign).
  - MLton-specific changes:
      - Added required MLton annotations to Giraffe library MLB files.
  - Added support for C array types.
  - Updated support for object types.  For a class C, object types are changed
     as follows:
        `'a <C>Class.t `  --->  `'a <C>Class.class`
        <none>            --->  `   <C>Class.t    `  (new local type)
        `'a <C>.class_t`  --->  `'a <C>.class     `
        `   <C>.t      `  <-->  `   <C>.t         `  (no change)
  - Added support for structure types.  (Previously, a limited number of record
     modules were created manually.)  For a record R, structure type
     `<R>.record_t` has been removed.
  - Added remaining parts of namespaces that can be supported.
  - Changed type names in the module Signal:
        `Signal.signal`     --->  `Signal.t`
        `Signal.signal_id`  --->  `Signal.id`
  - Generated codegen log in file 'excluded-log.page'.
  - Used non-option type for 'out' parameters conditional on error and ignored
     boolean return value if it indicates an error.


1.0.0-alpha.6 (2015-09-16)

  - Added type abbreviation for object and structure types:
      - for class C, object type `C.t` is equivalent to `base C.class_t`
      - for record R, structure type `R.t` is equivalent to `R.record_t`
  - Changed naming convention for types and constructors to use underscores
     between words in line with the Basis Library convention.
  - Changed Gdk button event names in line with GTK+ as follows:
      - `TWOBUTTONPRESS`   changed to `DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS`
      - `THREEBUTTONPRESS` changed to `TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS`
  - Removed experimental type-safe interface to style properties.  Style
     properties must be accessed via `GObject.Value` which is not type-safe.


1.0.0-alpha.5 (2015-05-29)

  - Added support for Darwin (Mac OS X).
  - Poly/ML 5.5.2 required.
  - Improved installation:
      - scripts compatible with Dash and Bash 3
      - further configure options and checks
      - corrections to file 'Makefile'
  - config.mk file installed to provide configuration to applications.
  - Archive (A) files built for MLton C libraries instead of object (O) files.
  - Fixed bugs in C libraries and turned on C compiler warnings.
  - Changed runtime licence to LGPL v2.1.

  - Added support for multiple versions of a library.
  - Added library vte-2.91.
  - Restructured source code directories.
  - Introduced configure script for installation.


1.0.0-alpha.3 (2014-12-19)

  - SML generated from GIR files:
      - no longer platform-specific
      - alias types included
  - Added support for Pango and GtkSourceView libraries.
  - `Pid.t` moved to `GLib.Pid.t`
  - FFI module for basic types restructured.
