1.0.0-alpha.8 (...)

    Removed restriction on Poly/ML 5.7 that required C function argument/return
     values with a C integer type to be in the range of Int.int which, in
     practice, required Int to be the same as IntInf.
    Generated C wrapper functions for use with MLton so all functions supported.
    Generated C functions to determine the size of value-like record types.
    Updated library versions:

1.0.0-alpha.7 (2017-10-18)

    Poly/ML 5.6 required.
    Poly/ML 5.7 supported.
    Poly/ML-specific changes:
      - Introduced finalizers based on weak references.
      - Used the new FFI (provided by the structure Foreign).
    MLton-specific changes:
      - Added required MLton annotations to Giraffe library MLB files.
    Added support for C array types.
    Updated support for object types.  For a class C, object types are changed
     as follows:
        'a <C>Class.t   --->  'a <C>Class.class
        <none>          --->     <C>Class.t  (new local type)
        'a <C>.class_t  --->  'a <C>.class
           <C>.t        <-->     <C>.t  (no change)
    Added support for structure types.  (Previously, a limited number of record
     modules were created manually.)  For a record R, structure type
     <R>.record_t has been removed.
    Added remaining parts of namespaces that can be supported.
    Changed type names in the module Signal:
        Signal.signal     --->  Signal.t
        Signal.signal_id  --->  Signal.id
    Generated codegen log in 'excluded-log.page'.
    Used non-option type for 'out' parameters conditional on error and ignored
     boolean return value if it indicates an error.


1.0.0-alpha.6 (2015-09-16)

    Added type abbreviation for object and structure types:
      - for class C, object type C.t = base C.class_t
      - for record R, structure type R.t = R.record_t
    Changed naming convention for types and constructors to use underscores
     between words in line with the Basis Library convention.
    Changed Gdk button event names in line with GTK+ as follows:
      - TWOBUTTONPRESS   changed to DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS
      - THREEBUTTONPRESS changed to TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS
    Removed experimental type-safe interface to style properties.  Style
     properties must be accessed via GObject.Value which is not type-safe.


1.0.0-alpha.5 (2015-05-29)

    Added support for Darwin (Mac OS X).
    Poly/ML 5.5.2 required.
    Improved installation:
      - scripts compatible with Dash and Bash 3
      - further configure options and checks
      - corrections to Makefile
    config.mk file installed to provide configuration to applications.
    Archive (A) files built for MLton C libraries instead of object (O) files.
    Fixed bugs in C libraries and turned on C compiler warnings.
    Changed runtime licence to LGPL v2.1.


1.0.0-alpha.4 (2015-02-08)

    Added support for multiple versions of a library.
    Added library vte-2.91.
    Restructured source code directories.
    Introduced configure script for installation.


1.0.0-alpha.3 (2014-12-19)

    SML generated from GIR files:
      - no longer platform-specific
      - alias types included
    Added support for Pango and GtkSourceView libraries.
    Pid.t moved to GLib.Pid.t
    FFI module for basic types restructured.
