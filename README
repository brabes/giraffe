the source release TAR file:

  giraffe-${VERSION}.tar.gz
                    - source release TAR file



2  Working directory initialization

Before code can be generated, the "codegen" directory requires the following
external dependencies to be added:

 1. the XML parser
 2. the GIR or TYPELIB files that provide the GObject Introspection data


2.1  XML parser

Under "codegen/src", the directory "xml" should contain the source code for the
simplified interface to fxp from Tom 7.  This is available at the following
locations:

  http://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/sml-lib/files/xml/
  https://github.com/robsimmons/sml-lib/tree/master/files/xml/


2.2  GObject Introspection data

Under "codegen", the directory "girepository" provides the GIR and TYPELIB files
used for code generation.  The files are organized in a tree with the following
structure:

  girepository/
    <namespace>-<version>/
      <pkg-version>/
        gir-1.0/
          <gi-version>/
            <Namespace>-<Version>.gir
        girepository-1.0/
          <gi-version>/
            <platform>/
              <Namespace>-<Version>.typelib

<pkg-version> is the version of the package that the GIR/TYPELIB file was
generated for.  Code generation takes the package version from the file
"version/<namespace>-<version>/version".

<gi-version> is the version of GObject Introspection that was used to generate
the GIR/TYPELIB file.  Code generation takes the GI version from the file
"giversion/<namespace>-<version>/giversion".

For example, we may have the following hierarchy from the GTK+ package:

  girepository/
    gtk-3.0/
      3.2.4/
        gir-1.0/
          1.30.0/Gtk-3.0.gir
          1.32.1/Gtk-3.0.gir
        girepository-1.0/
          1.30.0/
            x86_64/Gtk-3.0.typelib
            i686/Gtk-3.0.typelib
          1.32.1/x86_64/Gtk-3.0.typelib
      3.14.6/...
    gdk-3.0/...



3  Code generation

Code generation requires Poly/ML >= 5.6 and common GNU utilities.


3.1  Overview

Code is produced in stages:

 1. Generate code from GIR files
 2. Add non-generated files and, where required, fix generated code
 3. Copy final code to the main source tree to be included in the release

The output of stage 1 can be checked against code generated from TYPELIB files
to add confidence that the GIR files have been interpreted correctly, for
example, that correct default values have been assumed.  The code is checked in
stages:

 4. Generate code from TYPELIB files
 5. Convert code generated from GIR files to use platform-specific types
 6. Compare code from stages 4 and 5

The following diagram shows the data dependencies of these stages:


   Code from GIR files   :     Optional check against code from TYPELIB files
                         :
      .-----------.      :                                 .--------------.
      | GIR files |      :                                 | TYPELIB file |
      `-----------'      :                                 `--------------'
            | 1          :                                        | 4
            v            :                                        v
       .----------.      :  5   .-------------------.     .--------------.
       | SML code |------:----->| Platform-specific |     |   SML code   |
       | from GIR |      :      | SML code from GIR |     | from TYPELIB |
       `----------'      :      `-------------------'     `--------------'
            | 2          :                |                       |
            v            :                `----------. .----------'
    .----------------.   :                            | 6
    | fixed SML code |   :                            v
    `----------------'   :                     .-------------.
            | 3          :                     | GIR/TYPELIB |
            v            :                     | differences |
      .------------.     :                     `-------------'
      | SML source |     :
      |  release   |     :
      `------------'     :


3.2  Commands

The codegen script is used to invoke code generation.  At present, it performs
stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 described above.

To see a list of commands, enter

  ./codegen help

Commands that produce code write to a temporary directory under "/tmp".  A
corresponding "update-..." command copies the code from the temporary directory
to the working directory.  The update commands do not overwrite any existing
code in the working directory and, if existing code is different, it will invoke
a merge tool, if defined by the environment variable MERGE, to allow differences
to be reviewed.  This approach is taken to compare easily differences introduced
in the generated code against the original code in the working directory.


3.3  Using GIR files

Giraffe Library is generated from GIR files to produce library code that is
portable across all platforms.  Although GIR files include some platform-
specific data, such data is not (or should not be) used.

Stage 1

In a working directory, library code is generated in the directory "auto-0-gir"
using the following commands:

  ./codegen gir
  ./codegen update-gir

Stage 2

Fixed library code is generated in the directory "fixed-gir" by applying fixes
to the code in "auto-0-gir" using the commands

  ./codegen fixed
  ./codegen update-fixed

Stage 3

The code in "fixed-gir" is copied into the source release directory using the
command

  ./codegen update-source

The code in "fixed-gir" is removed from the source release directory using the
command

  ./codegen remove-source


3.4  Check using TYPELIB files

Although it is possible to generate code from TYPELIB files, they are designed
for dynamic (run-time) introspection and, for efficiency, are platform-specific.
Consequently, TYPELIB files do not have sufficient information to generate
portable code because
  - types are resolved for the platform, for example, glong is
      - gint32 in the TYPELIB for a 32 bit platform and is
      - gint64 in the TYPELIB for a 64 bit platform;
  - the version at which entities are introduced is not stored so, for example,
    references in C code to struct types cannot be protected for use on
    platforms with older libraries.
Also, alias types are resolved to the underlying type, which reduces
traceability to the API documentation.

At present, code is generated from TYPELIB files only for the purpose of
comparison with code generated from GIR files, to add confidence that the
SML GIRepository interface to GIR files is giving correct information.

It is planned that code generated from TYPELIB should be usable on the platform
that is was generated on, using dynamic linking.

Stage 4

The SML bindings to the GIRepository C library require SML bindings for the
GLib and GObject namespaces.  Therefore, before stage 4 is performed, stages 1
to 3 must be performed and, in the source release directory, the commands
  ./configure ...
and
  make
run in order to build Giraffe C interface libraries in the working directory.

Then library code is generated in the directory "auto-0-typelib" by the
following commands:

  ./codegen typelib
  ./codegen update-typelib

Stage 5

There is no codegen command to perform stage 5.  The script
"gir2typelib/convert" should be run from a directory that is a copy of
"auto-0-gir", the code generated from GIR files, that is to be converted.

Stage 6

There is no codegen command to perform stage 6.  This should be performed
manually using the Diff program (or equivalent) to compare "auto-0-typelib"
from stage 4 with the converted code from stage 5.



4  Manual code

In the "codegen" directory, the following directories contain hand-written code
or generated code that has been fixed by hand:

  fixes-1-gir/      - code that is fixed to work around incorrect GI data
  fixes-2-gir/      - code that is fixed to work around Giraffe limitations
  extra-gir/        - code that is not generated

"fixes-1-gir" should no longer be used.  Instead, "src/overrides.sml" should be
updated to override the incorrect GIR data.  At present, not all data can be
overridden so "src/GIRepository.sml" may need to be modified to introduce a new
override.

"fixes-2-gir" is used for various reasons.  At present, the main reasons are to:
  - provide modules for a root class of a hierarchy (generated as empty files);
  - provide modules for record types (generated as empty files);
  - provide modules for callback types (not generated);
  - introduce abstractions in fundamental GObject modules such as GObject.Type
     and GObject.Closure;
  - provide modules for GDK event record types that capture event hierarchy
     indicated by the GdkEvent union type;
  - add Gtk.init and any other function that uses array types;
  - ignore parts of namespaces, e.g. Gio.

"extra-gir" provides source code that is not generated.  At present, this
includes:
  - special GObject modules: Signal, Property and ClosureMarshal;
  - a module to classify, i.e. downcast, a GdkEvent record;
  - other modules that introduce abstractions.



5  MLton-specific code generation

The generated code provides C functions that wrap library functions in order to
use a different representation for C array parameters that allows MLton to pass
an optional SML vector as an optionally-null C pointer.  Note, therefore, that
C wrapper functions are generated only for functions with arguments that are
vector-like.

MLton-specific code generation requires Poly/ML 5.6 and common GNU utilities.

5.1  Overview

MLton-specific code is produced in stages:

 1. Generate code from GIR files
 2. Fix generated code
 3. Copy final code to the main source tree to be included in the release

The following diagram shows the data dependencies of these stages:


   Code from GIR files

      .-----------.
      | GIR files |
      `-----------'
            | 1
            v
       .----------.
       |  C code  |
       | from GIR |
       `----------'
            | 2
            v
    .----------------.
    |  fixed C code  |
    `----------------'
            | 3
            v
      .------------.
      |  C source  |
      |  release   |
      `------------'


3.2  Commands

The mlton-codegen script is used to invoke code generation stages 1, 2 and 3
described above.

To see a list of commands, enter

  ./mlton-codegen help

Commands that produce code write to a temporary directory under "/tmp".  A
corresponding "update-..." command copies the code from the temporary directory
to the working directory.  The update commands do not overwrite any existing
code in the working directory and, if existing code is different, it will invoke
a merge tool, if defined by the environment variable MERGE, to allow differences
to be reviewed.  This approach is taken to compare easily differences introduced
in the generated code against the original code in the working directory.

The C function wrapper code is produced only from GIR files because the required
information is not stored in TYPELIB files.

Stage 1

In a working directory, library code is generated in the directory "mlton-auto"
by the following commands:

  ./mlton-codegen gir
  ./mlton-codegen update-gir

Stage 2

Fixed library code is generated in the directory "mlton-fixed" by applying fixes
to the code in "mlton-auto" using the commands

  ./mlton-codegen fixed
  ./mlton-codegen update-fixed

Stage 3

The code in "mlton-fixed" is copied into the source release directory by the
command

  ./mlton-codegen update-source

The code in "mlton-fixed" is removed from the source release directory by the
command

  ./mlton-codegen remove-source
