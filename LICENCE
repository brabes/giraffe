There are two licences:

 1. Giraffe Library (Run-Time) Licence

    This applies to files in the directory 'release', both static files and
    files created there as a result of code generation.  These files form the
    library release.

    See 'release/LICENCE.RUNTIME'.

 2. Giraffe Code Generator Licence

    This applies to files in this repository EXCEPT those in
      - the directory 'release' (see item 1 above)
      - the directory 'src/xml' (see the file 'src/xml/README')
      - directories for Git submodules, as listed in the file '.gitmodules'

    See 'LICENCE.CODEGEN'.
